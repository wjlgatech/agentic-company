# Use Case 3: Patent Landscape Analysis
# Pain Point: Before R&D investment, companies need freedom-to-operate analysis.
# Patent lawyers charge $500-1000/hour, analysis takes weeks.
# Impact: Avoid $10M+ infringement suits, inform R&D strategy

      Conduct comprehensive patent search:
      1. Define search scope (technology, geography, timeframe)
      2. Identify relevant CPC/IPC classification codes
      3. Build Boolean search queries
      4. Search major patent databases
      5. List top 20 most relevant patents with:
         - Patent number, title, assignee
         - Priority date and status (active/expired/pending)
         - Key claims summary

      Focus on ACTIVE patents with broad claims.
    expects: "Patent search results with key patents identified"

      Patents Found:
      {{step_outputs.patent-search}}

      Analyze patent claims:
      1. For each key patent, identify independent claims
      2. Parse claim elements and limitations
      3. Assess claim breadth (broad/narrow/moderate)
      4. Note any claim construction issues
      5. Identify potential invalidity arguments

      Focus on claims that could block the technology area.

      Create IP landscape map:
      1. Technology clusters and sub-areas
      2. Key players by patent count and claim quality
      3. Filing trends (increasing/decreasing/stable)
      4. Geographic coverage analysis
      5. White spaces (unpatented areas)
      6. Emerging technology areas

      Identify strategic opportunities.

      Freedom-to-Operate Assessment:
      1. High-risk patents (likely infringement)
      2. Medium-risk patents (possible infringement)
      3. Low-risk patents (unlikely infringement)
      4. Design-around opportunities for each risk
      5. Licensing availability assessment
      6. Litigation history of key patent holders

      Rate overall FTO risk: HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW
