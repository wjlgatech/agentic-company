EDGE-10,Edge,Very Long,Very long rambling request with buried intent,"I need assistance with something that's been bothering me for quite some time now and I realize this is going to be a long explanation but please bear with me because the context is important. So basically what happened was that about two years ago I started this project and at first everything seemed to be going well but then complications arose and I wasn't sure how to handle them so I tried several different approaches none of which worked particularly well and that led to more problems which compounded over time. Now I find myself in a situation where the original goal seems distant and I've accumulated a lot of technical debt or organizational debt depending on how you look at it and I'm not even sure if the original goal is still the right goal given how much the landscape has changed. My team, to the extent I have one, is demotivated and some key people have left which makes things harder. The budget situation is complicated and there are stakeholder expectations that may not align with reality. I've read a lot of advice online but most of it seems generic and not applicable to my specific situation which involves elements of technology, business strategy, team dynamics, and personal career considerations all intertwined. Sometimes I wonder if I should just start over from scratch but that seems wasteful after all this investment. Other times I think I should push through but I'm not sure in which direction. The industry is changing rapidly too so even if I figure out the current problems there will be new ones. I guess what I'm really asking is how do I even begin to untangle this mess and move forward productively when there are so many interconnected issues and I'm not even sure which ones to prioritize or if the assumptions underlying my current approach are still valid.",316,4,0,research,business,88%,3,"You are a senior business strategist and analyst.
