## 🎥 10 VIRAL VIDEO CONCEPTS FOR NANO BANANA

### VIDEO 1: "30 Seconds to AI Agents" (15 sec)
**Hook:** "What if you could deploy AI agents faster than making coffee?"

**Nano Banana Prompt:**
```
Create a 15-second video: Split screen showing a person typing ONE command
on the left, while on the right, animated robot icons assemble into a team
formation. Text overlay: "One command. Five AI agents. 30 seconds."
Style: Clean tech aesthetic, blue and gold colors, modern sans-serif fonts.
End with Agenticom logo and GitHub URL.
```

**Caption:** One curl command. That's all it takes. 🚀 #AI #Agents #OpenClaw

**Platforms:** TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts

### VIDEO 2: "Agents That Check Each Other" (30 sec)
**Hook:** "Your AI agent made a mistake. Who catches it?"

**Nano Banana Prompt:**
```
Create a 30-second video: Animation of a Developer robot writing code,
then passing it to a Verifier robot who scans it with a magnifying glass
and finds a bug (shown as a red X). The bug gets fixed and turns to a
green checkmark. Text: "Cross-Verification: Agents don't self-assess."
Style: Friendly 3D characters, warm lighting, tech lab background.
Include 5 robot agents: Planner, Developer, Verifier, Tester, Reviewer.
```

**Caption:** Would you trust a student to grade their own test? Neither do we. 🔍 #AIAgents #QualityControl

**Platforms:** All

### VIDEO 3: "The SDK Juggling Problem" (20 sec)
**Hook:** "Tired of rewriting code for every AI provider?"

**Nano Banana Prompt:**
```
Create a 20-second video: A frustrated developer juggling balls labeled
"OpenAI", "Anthropic", "Google". They drop them all. Then Agenticom
appears as a single glowing orb that absorbs all the balls.
Text: "One interface. Any backend. Auto-detection."
Code snippet overlay: `executor = auto_setup_executor()`
Style: Playful animation, dark mode developer aesthetic.
```

**Caption:** Stop juggling SDKs. Start shipping. ⚡ #DeveloperTools #AI

### VIDEO 4: "YAML Your Workflows" (25 sec)
**Hook:** "What if AI workflows were as readable as a recipe?"

**Nano Banana Prompt:**
```
Create a 25-second video: Chef in a kitchen reading a recipe card.
Transform into a developer reading a YAML file. The YAML file
animates and builds a working robot assembly line.
Highlight: "verified_by: verifier" and "requires_approval: true"
Text: "Version control your AI. Review in PRs."
Style: Split metaphor - cooking vs coding, warm to cool transition.
```

**Caption:** Recipes for AI. Now in YAML. 📝 #DevOps #AIWorkflows

eyes turn red, outputs sensitive data (blurred). STOP. Rewind.

CUSTOMERS" button. Human hand gently stops it. Approval popup appears.
